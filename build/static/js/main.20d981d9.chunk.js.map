Am Wochenende kann man die Strapazen des Alltags vergessen. Wenn das Wetter schön ist, fahren viele Städter ins Grüne. Man macht einen Ausflug, ein Picknick im Freien oder verbringt das Wochenende auf dem Lande. Es ist gesund, ein paar Stunden mitten in der Natur zu verbringen, frische Luft einzuatmen und für einige Zeit den Stadtlärm zu vergessen. Wenn es aber kalt oder regnerisch ist, macht man sich zu Hause gemütlich. Man kann diese Zeit mit seinen Freunden oder im Kreis der Familie verbringen. Manchmal verbringt man seine Freizeit mit sich allein. Es ist angenehm, sich nach der Hektik in den gemütlichen Sessel zu setzen und ruhige Musik zu hören oder ein Buch zu lesen. In den Städten gibt es viele Möglichkeiten, die Freizeit zu gestalten. Man kann ins Theater oder ins Konzert gehen. Uns stehen zahlreiche Kinos, Ausstellungen, Museen zur Verfügung. Zu den beliebtesten und erlebnisreichsten Freizeitbeschäftigungen gehören Wandern und Reisen.

Keine Zeit, sagen viele. Andere kochen nicht gern. Oder sie denken: Das ist zu viel Arbeit. In vielen Familien gibt es ein- bis zweimal pro Woche Fertiggerichte wie Tiefkühlpizza, Tütensuppe oder Konserven. Essen ist Nebensache. Bei jedem Dritten läuft beim Essen der Fernseher oder der Computer. Besonders junge Menschen haben nicht viel Zeit – oder wollen sich keine Zeit nehmen. Beim Essen sehen 40 Prozent der Menschen unter 25 Jahren fern oder sie surfen im Internet. Ist Essen allein langweilig? Fast 60 Prozent der jungen Menschen sagen: Essen muss lecker sein. Sie essen oft Fertiggerichte und Fastfood: 60 Prozent essen mindestens einmal pro Woche ein Fertiggericht. 33 Prozent essen mindestens dreimal pro Woche im Schnellimbiss – Burger, Pommes oder Currywurst. 90 Prozent der Menschen unter 25 Jahren sagen: Wir essen nicht sehr gesund.―\",\r\n            textA1Gaps: [\r\n              {original:\"nemis tilida\",translate:\"tarjimasi\"},\r\n              {original:\"nemis tilida\",translate:\"tarjimasi\"},\r\n                ],\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            textId: \"textA1_3\",\r\n            textProp: 4,\r\n            textLabel: \"5\",\r\n            textTitle: \"Große Gesundheitsumfrage: Leben Sie gesund?\",\r\n            textContent:\"Marina Beketova, 27 (Studentin).
