Man kann sich entspannen, viele Menschen gehen ihrer Lieblingsbeschäftigung nach. Die anderen treiben Sport, lesen, hören Musik, sehen fern, spielen am Computer, quatschen mit den Freunden. Am Wochenende kann man die Strapazen des Alltags vergessen. Wenn das Wetter schön ist, fahren viele Städter ins Grüne. Man macht einen Ausflug, ein Picknick im Freien oder verbringt das Wochenende auf dem Lande. Es ist gesund, ein paar Stunden mitten in der Natur zu verbringen, frische Luft einzuatmen und für einige Zeit den Stadtlärm zu vergessen. Wenn es aber kalt oder regnerisch ist, macht man sich zu Hause gemütlich. Man kann diese Zeit mit seinen Freunden oder im Kreis der Familie verbringen. Manchmal verbringt man seine Freizeit mit sich allein. Es ist angenehm, sich nach der Hektik in den gemütlichen Sessel zu setzen und ruhige Musik zu hören oder ein Buch zu lesen. In den Städten gibt es viele Möglichkeiten, die Freizeit zu gestalten. Man kann ins Theater oder ins Konzert gehen. Uns stehen zahlreiche Kinos, Ausstellungen, Museen zur Verfügung. Zu den beliebtesten und erlebnisreichsten Freizeitbeschäftigungen gehören Wandern und Reisen. Dabei lernen wir viel kennen, erweitern unseren Horizont und bekommen viele neue Eindrücke. \",\r\n            textA1Gaps: [\r\n              {original:\"unser\",translate:\"bizning\"},\r\n

Wie essen die Deutschen? Was ist den Deutschen beim Essen wichtig? Das hat eine Studie der Techniker Krankenkasse untersucht. Hier sind einige Ergebnisse: In nur 50 Prozent der Haushalte in Deutschland kochen die Menschen jeden Tag selbst. In jedem dritten Haushalt kochen die Menschen nur drei- bis fünfmal pro Woche. Warum? Keine Zeit, sagen viele. Andere kochen nicht gern. Oder sie denken: Das ist zu viel Arbeit. In vielen Familien gibt es ein- bis zweimal pro Woche Fertiggerichte wie Tiefkühlpizza, Tütensuppe oder Konserven. Essen ist Nebensache. Bei jedem Dritten läuft beim Essen der Fernseher oder der Computer. Besonders junge Menschen haben nicht viel Zeit – oder wollen sich keine Zeit nehmen. Beim Essen sehen 40 Prozent der Menschen unter 25 Jahren fern oder sie surfen im Internet. Ist Essen allein langweilig? Fast 60 Prozent der jungen Menschen sagen: Essen muss lecker sein. Sie essen oft Fertiggerichte und Fastfood: 60 Prozent essen mindestens einmal pro Woche ein Fertiggericht. 33 Prozent essen mindestens dreimal pro Woche im Schnellimbiss – Burger, Pommes oder Currywurst. 90 Prozent der Menschen unter 25 Jahren sagen: Wir essen nicht sehr gesund.―\",\r\n            textA1Gaps: [\r\n              {original:\"essen\",translate:\"yemoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"was\",translate:\"nima\"},\r\n              {original:\"Deutschland\",translate:\"Germaniya\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Studie\",translate:\"o´rganish\"},\r\n              {original:\"der Techniker\",translate:\"texnikachi\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Krankenkasse\",translate:\"kasalxona kassasi\"},\r\n              {original:\"wie\",translate:\"qanday\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Deutschen\",translate:\"nemislar\"},\r\n              {original:\"beim Essen\",translate:\"ovqatda, ovqatlanishda\"},\r\n              {original:\"wichtig\",translate:\"muhim\"},\r\n              {original:\"das\",translate:\"bu\"},\r\n              {original:\"untersuchen\",translate:\"tekshirmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"hier\",translate:\"bu yerda\"},\r\n              {original:\"einige\",translate:\"ba´zi\"},\r\n              {original:\"einige Ergebnisse\",translate:\"ba´zi natijalar\"},\r\n              {original:\"Prozent\",translate:\"foiz\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Haushalte\",translate:\"uy ishlari\"},\r\n              {original:\"in Deutschland\",translate:\"Germaniyada\"},\r\n              {original:\"kochen\",translate:\"tayyorlamoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Menschen\",translate:\"odamlar\"},\r\n              {original:\"jeden Tag\",translate:\"har kuni\"},\r\n              {original:\"selbst\",translate:\"mustaqil\"},\r\n              {original:\"drei\",translate:\"uch\"},\r\n              {original:\"nur\",translate:\"faqat\"},\r\n              {original:\"bis\",translate:\"...gacha\"},\r\n              {original:\"fünfmal\",translate:\"besh marta\"},\r\n              {original:\"pro Woche\",translate:\"haftasiga\"},\r\n              {original:\"warum\",translate:\"nima uchun\"},\r\n              {original:\"sagen\",translate:\"aytmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"viel\",translate:\"ko´p\"},\r\n              {original:\"andere\",translate:\"boshqa\"},\r\n              {original:\"nicht\",translate:\"yo´q\"},\r\n              {original:\"gern\",translate:\"bajonidil\"},\r\n              {original:\"oder\",translate:\"yoki\"},\r\n              {original:\"denken\",translate:\"o´ylamoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Arbeit\",translate:\"ish\"},\r\n              {original:\"in vielen Familie\",translate:\"ko´p oilalarda\"},\r\n              {original:\"gibt es\",translate:\"bor bo´lmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Woche\",translate:\"hafta\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Fertiggerichte\",translate:\"tayyor ovqatlar\"},\r\n              {original:\"wie\",translate:\"huddi\"},\r\n              {original:\"das Essen\",translate:\"ovqat\"},\r\n              {original:\"die Nebensache\",translate:\"kichik narsa\"},\r\n              {original:\"laufen\",translate:\"yugurmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"der Fernseher\",translate:\"televizor\"},\r\n              {original:\"der Computer\",translate:\"kompyuter\"},\r\n              {original:\"besonders\",translate:\"o´ziga xos\"},\r\n              {original:\"junge Menschen\",translate:\"yosh odamlar\"},\r\n              {original:\"wollen\",translate:\"hohlamoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"sich nehmen\",translate:\"olmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"fernsehen\",translate:\"TV ko´rmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"unter 25 Jahren\",translate:\"25 yoshdan oshganlar\"},\r\n              {original:\"surfen im Internet\",translate:\"internetda suzmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"allein\",translate:\"yolg´iz\"},\r\n              {original:\"langweilig\",translate:\"zerikarli\"},\r\n              {original:\"fast\",translate:\"deyarli\"},\r\n              {original:\"sagen\",translate:\"aytmoq\"},\r\n              {original:\"lecker\",translate:\"mazali\"},\r\n              {original:\"müssen\",translate:\"kerak, lozim\"},\r\n              {original:\"oft\",translate:\"tez-tez\"},\r\n              {original:\"mindestens\",translate:\"kamchilik\"},\r\n              {original:\"einmal\",translate:\"bir marta\"},\r\n              {original:\"dreimal\",translate:\"uch marta\"},\r\n              {original:\"sehr gesund\",translate:\"juda sog´lom\"},\r\n                ],\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            textId: \"textA1_3\",\r\n            textProp: 4,\r\n            textLabel: \"5\",\r\n            textTitle: \"Große Gesundheitsumfrage: Leben Sie gesund?\",\r\n            textContent:\"Marina Beketova, 27 (Studentin).

Danach fahre ich mit dem Fahrrad in die Universität. Mittags mache ich eine Pause. Ich gehe in die Cafeteria, treffe Freunde und esse etwas. An zwei Nachmittagen habe ich frei. Dann gehe ich schwimmen. Sport ist gesund und tut gut. Konstantinos Antoniadis, 53 (Kellner) Meine Gesundheit? Ja, die ist mir sehr wichtig! Ich lebe in einem Dorf. Da gibt es viel Natur und die Luft ist noch gut. In der Stadt gibt es zu viele Autos. Ich fahre selbst viel Auto, aber im Sommer fahre ich auch gerne Fahrrad. Ich arbeite in einem Restaurant. Da muss man viel stehen und gehen. Oft tut mir dann am Abend die Füße weh und ich habe auch ein bisschen Rückenschmerzen. Dann gehe ich schwimmen und es geht mir wieder gut.
